## Test Framework


#### Intro
The first part of this unit introduces you to test-driven development. More than anything, **TDD is a mindset**. It seeks to help you **codify expected behaviour** of a program to allow you to maintain and extend it easily and with confidence.

NB: For the duration of this unit, you will build and use your own test framework without needing to use external code.

#### Objectives

- [ ] Build a simple test framework
- [ ] Explain how a test framework works
- [ ] Convert acceptance criteria into tests
- [ ] Test-drive a simple program

#### Project Steps


- [acceptance criteria](./test-framework/acceptance-criteria.md)
- [a simple test framework](./test-framework/a-simple-test-framework.md)
- [codify expected behaviour](./test-framework/codify-expected-behaviour.md)
- [practice](./test-framework/practice-makes-perfect.md)


Go through the steps in order. The instructions in each step give you some prompting, and you can see a possible implementation in some of the examples. Feel free to stick closely to the examples or find your own way to the Acceptance Criteria. If you'd like to change the criteria, see a coach first!
