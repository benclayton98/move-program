# Practice Makes Perfect

## Intro

Nice job - you're all set up now to test-drive developing programs. Now practice the red-green-refactor loop until it's subconscious!

1. Let's start again. This time you're creating it from scratch.

Test-drive the sister method: count odd numbers.

Write a program that you can run in your node repl that can find how many odd numbers are in a list of numbers

# Acceptance Criteria
Input => Output
[1,2,3,4,5,6] => 3
[0,1,2] => 1
[2,4,6] => 0


2. Now go back and test-drive the Scrabble Challenge from scratch. Then test-drive the Bank Project. (And any other project you'd like). The exercises can be completed in the following two different ways depending on your objective:

### 1. Pair programming - as you have been doing so far.
#### Goal
Practice pair programming and test-driving your work.
#### Instructions
  1. Understand the requirements
  2. Choose who is Driver and Navigator
  2. Red, Green, Refactor!
    - Write your test
    - Write code to pass the test
    - Refactor
    - Switch Roles

### 2. Developer and Observer
#### Goal
Identify improvements to your test-driven development process
#### Instructions
  1. Choose roles
  2. Observer sets a timer for 30 mins
  3. Developer sets up their environment ready to start
  4. Developer records their screen
  5. Observer notes when the Developer flails
  6. Switch Roles and go to 2.
