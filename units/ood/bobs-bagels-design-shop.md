## Welcome to Bob's Bagels Design Shop!

### Setup

1. Clone a Bob's Bagels repository from the list below.
2. `git checkout -b` a new branch in the format [cohort_id-name1-name2...etc]. eg: `mse-2103-a-ed-edsfriend`.
3. Find or create the README.md, and add your names to the top of it.
4. Push your branch to the remote and open a PR to the `main` branch.


### Instructions

1. Document your understanding of the current project by adding a diagram of the current system to the  README.
    1. Use the project README (complete one if empty)
    2. Read and run the specs
    3. Read and run the code.
2. Are there any missing specs? Write them.
3. Spot any immediate code-smells. Refactor.
4. Make sure tests are passing.
5. Break up the next user story/acceptance criteria and start work.

_NB: The intention is not to rewrite the challenge, but to refactor and extend it, step by step._
